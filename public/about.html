<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Having a real interest in video games, I had the opportunity to study video
   game programming and thus have the chance to create my own games. With 
   nearly three years of hands-on experience in the games industry, I had the 
   opportunity to hone my game programming skills in areas such as game 
   mechanics, AI programming, performance optimization, debugging complex 
   problems, as well as UI implementation, and multiplayer game creation. 
   I'm proficient in languages such as C++, C#, Lua, and Verse, and I'm very 
   comfortable using tools such as Unity, Unreal, and Maya. I've always worked
    with the agile method, so Perforce and Hansoft are no strangers to me. I 
    love teamwork and always put my heart and soul into these projects to 
    create games that can inspire others. Autonomous, responsible, and 
    passionate, I'm always ready to take on any challenge that comes my way</p>
